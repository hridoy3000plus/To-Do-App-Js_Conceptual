# Simple Todo List

A simple, interactive to-do list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add, edit, toggle completion, and delete tasks. It also uses `localStorage` to persist tasks across page reloads.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks to the list by typing into an input field and clicking the "Add Task" button (or pressing Enter).
- **Edit Tasks**: Edit existing tasks by clicking the edit button next to each task. The text will become editable, and you can change it as needed.
- **Toggle Completion**: Mark tasks as complete by checking the checkbox next to each task. Completed tasks are visually distinguished with a line-through.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list by clicking the trash bin button.
- **Persistence**: All tasks are stored in `localStorage` so that the list persists even after refreshing the page.
